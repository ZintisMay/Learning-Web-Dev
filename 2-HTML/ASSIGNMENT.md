# Assignment 1

You'll see a file called tags.html in this folder. Try out all the tags in there, and see how they display on the page. 

Don't worry about styling, just watch what they look like and their behavior. 

You don't need to memorize them all.

Write in each tag it's name, then how it is used. Some tags you cannot write inside (as they are self-closing, look that up), so just write what they do on the side.
