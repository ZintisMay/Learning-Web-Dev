# Assignment 1

Watching the video on the terminal and github, you will use both to merge the 2-HTML branch into yours.

Whenever you see <this> syntax, it means insert the indicated text into that spot, but WITHOUT the < and >.

For example, "<name>" will end up being "John".

Steps:

1. Go to terminal.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this project. Above your cursor, the line there should end in (master) or (<branch name>)
3. Git checkout -b "<Your Name>"
4. Git merge 2-HTML

Now look in your files. Notice that there is a 2nd folder called 2-HTML. Git merge has added these changes from the 2-HTML branch to yours. 

You can now do the 2-HTML Lesson and Assignment.

As you complete assignments, you'll follow these steps:

1. Go to terminal.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this project. Above your cursor, the line there should end in (<branch name>)
3. Git add -A
4. Git commit -m "<put a message of what you did in the code here, keep it short>"
5. Git push
<!-- If git push doesn't work then: -->
<!-- Git Push Origin <your branch name> -->

Now go to github, and look at the repo. In the branches tab find your branch. Look at the files that are in that branch, and check if they match the files on your local machine.
