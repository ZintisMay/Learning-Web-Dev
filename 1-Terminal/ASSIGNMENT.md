#Assignment

This is a short assigment. 

Watching the video on the terminal and github, you will use both to merge the 2-HTML branch into yours.

Whenever you see <this> syntax, it means insert the indicated text into that spot, but WITHOUT the < and >.

For example, "<name>" will end up being "John".

Steps:

1. Go to terminal.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this project. Above your cursor, the line there should end in (master) or (<branch name>)
3. Git checkout -b "<Your Name>"
4. Git merge 2-HTML

Now look in your files. Notice that there is a 2nd folder called 2-HTML. Git merge has added these changes from the 2-HTML branch to yours. 

You can now do the 2-HTML Lesson and Assignment.
