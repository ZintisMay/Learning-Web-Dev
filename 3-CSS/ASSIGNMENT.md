# Assignment 1

You'll see a file called tryCSS.html in this folder.

Study the following CSS concepts, and try to implement it in the Style tag in the Head of at file.

Topics that I think are most important in the beginning are:

- Syntax
- Selectors
- Colors
- Backgrounds
- Borders
- Margins
- Padding
- Height/Width
- Box Model
- Text
- Fonts
- Links
- Display
- Max-width
- Position
- Overflow
- Inline-block
- Opacity

# Assignment 2

Go into the tagsOnly.html file. Try and style the elements on the page to have the appropriate background color. Only use tag selectors. Don't stress if you can't get them all, the last 2 are difficult.

# Assignment 3

Do the same for the classOnly.html file. It should be MUCH easier than the tag one.

# Assignment 4

Read this article:

# Assignment 5

Make a new HTML file. 

Make some HTML elements that you've used from 2-HTML. 

Style them using some of the CSS attributes that you've learned in this module.

Try to use a variety of elements and attributes. Your goal here is to see how the different styles interact with the elements.

# Assignment 6

Make a copy of tagsOnly.html, call it overrideTagSelector.html. Give some of the elements classes. Use classes to over-write the styles you wrote before.

# Assignment 7

Make a copy of classOnly.html, call it overrideClassSelector.html. Give some of the elements classes. Use classes to over-write the styles you wrote before.

# Assignment 8

You can also style using the id="<name>" attribute of tags. 

You can also style using the style="<attribute>:<setting>;" attribute of tags. 

These should generally not be used, although you should be familiar enough with them to know when they are appropriate.

Try using each once, in the overrideClassSelector.html file.
