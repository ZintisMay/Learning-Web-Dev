# Learning-Web-Dev

This repository is meant to be a series of lessons, each in a folder on a branch. 

As you go through the lessons, the material in the folder can be reviewed, and a new lesson can be pulled into your branch.

Using this repo will also get you accustomed to using version control and Github. 

Try using the resources included in each folder's readme (videos, articles, references), but feel free to reinforce your learning using other resources. 

HOWEVER do be careful that the technologies in those other resources are the same. It is possible to use certain technologies in two different ways, and those ways may not be compatible with each other.
